### A Google Apps Script library for accessing Google Cloud Firestore.


This library allows a user (or service account) to authenticate with Firestore and edit their Firestore database within a Google Apps Script.

Read how this project was started [here](//grahamearley.website/blog/2017/10/18/firestore-in-google-apps-script.html).

As of **v27**, this project has been updated to use the [GAS V8 runtime](//developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime) with [Typescript](//www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-9.html)! This introduces a number of [breaking changes](#breaking-changes). Scripts utilizing the old Rhino runtime must use **v26**.

## Installation
In the Google online script editor, select the `Resources` menu item and choose `Libraries...`. In the "Add a library" input box, enter **`1VUSl4b1r1eoNcRWotZM3e87ygkxvXltOgyDZhixqncz9lQ3MjfT1iKFw`** and click "Add." Choose the most recent version number.

## Quick start
#### Creating a service account
The easiest way to use this library is to create a Google Service Account for your application and give it read/write access to your datastore. Giving a service account access to your datastore is like giving access to a user's account, but this account is strictly used by your script, not by a person.

If you don't already have a Firestore project you want to use, create one at the [Firebase admin console](//console.firebase.google.com).

To make a service account,
1. Open the [Google Service Accounts page by clicking here](//console.developers.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts). 
2. Select your Firestore project, and then click "Create Service Account." 
3. For your service account's role, choose `Datastore > Cloud Datastore Owner`. 
4. Check the "Furnish a new private key" box and select JSON as your key type. 
5. When you press "Create," your browser will download a `.json` file with your private key (`private_key`), service account email (`client_email`), and project ID (`project_id`). Copy these values into your Google Apps Script â€” you'll need them to authenticate with Firestore.
6. **[Bonus]** It is considered best practice to make use of the [Properties Service](//developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) to store this sensitive information.

#### Configurating Firestore instance from your script
Now, with your service account client email address `email`, private key `key`, project ID `projectId`, we will authenticate with Firestore to get our `Firestore` object. To do this, get the `Firestore` object from the library:

```javascript
const firestore = FirestoreApp.getFirestore(email, key, projectId);
```

##### Configuration Template
Here's a quick template to get you started (by replacing `email` and `key` with your values):
```javascript
const email = 'projectname-12345@appspot.gserviceaccount.com';
const key = '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPrivateKeyLine1\nPrivateKeyLine2\nPrivateKeyLineN\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----';
const projectId = 'projectname-12345'
const firestore = FirestoreApp.getFirestore(email, key, projectId);
```

Alternatively, using [Properties Service](//developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) <ins>once data is already stored</ins> in the service with **"client_email"**, **"private_key"**, and **"project_id"** property names:
```javascript
const props = PropertiesService.getUserProperties(); // Or .getScriptProperties() if stored in Script Properties
const [email, key, projectId] = [props.getProperty('client_email'), props.getProperty('private_key'), props.getProperty('project_id')];
const firestore = FirestoreApp.getFirestore(email, key, projectId);
```


##### Creating Documents
Using this Firestore instance, we will create a Firestore document with a field `name` with value `test!`. Let's encode this as a JSON object:

```javascript
const data = {
  "name": "test!"
}
```

We can choose to create a document in collection called **"FirstCollection"** without a name (Firestore will generate one):

```javascript
firestore.createDocument("FirstCollection", data);
```

Alternatively, we can create the document in the **"FirstCollection"** collection called **"FirstDocument"**:
```javascript
firestore.createDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument", data);
```

##### Updating Documents
To update (overwrite) the document at this location, we can use the `updateDocument` function:
```javascript
firestore.updateDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument", data);
```

To update only specific fields of a document at this location, we can set the `mask` parameter to `true`:
```javascript
firestore.updateDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument", data, true);
```

Or alternatiavely, we can set the `mask` parameter to an array of field names:
```javascript
firestore.updateDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument", data, ["field1", "field2", "fieldN"]);
```
this is useful for [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.databases.documents/patch#query-parameters):
> If the document exists on the server and has fields not referenced in the mask, they are left unchanged. Fields referenced in the mask, but not present in the input document (the `data` in our example), are deleted from the document on the server.

##### Deleting Documents
To delete a document at this location, we can use the `deleteDocument` function:
```javascript
firestore.deleteDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument");
```
**Note:** This cannot handle deleting collections or subcollections, *only* individual documents.

##### Getting Documents
You can retrieve documents by calling the `getDocument` function:

```javascript
const documentWithMetadata = firestore.getDocument("FirstCollection/FirstDocument");
```

You can also retrieve all documents within a collection by using the `getDocuments` function:

```javascript
const allDocuments = firestore.getDocuments("FirstCollection");
```

You can also get specific documents by providing an array of document names

```javascript
const someDocuments = firestore.getDocuments("FirstCollection", ["Doc1", "Doc2", "Doc3"]);
```

##### Getting Document Properties
You can access various properties of documents from Firestore:

```javascript
const doc          = firestore.getDocument("My Collection/My Document");
const originalData = doc.obj      // Original database object (your stored data)
const readTime     = doc.read     // Date Object of the Read time from database
const updateTime   = doc.updated  // Date Object of the Updated time from database
const createdTime  = doc.created  // Date Object of the Created time from database
const name         = doc.name     // Full document path (projects/projName/databases/(default)/documents/My Collection/My Document)
const path         = doc.path     // Local document path (My Collection/My Document)
```

##### Getting Documents (Advanced method using Query)
If more specific queries need to be performed, you can use the `query` function followed by an `.Execute()` invocation to get that data:
    
```javascript
const allDocumentsWithTest = firestore.query("FirstCollection").Where("name", "==", "Test!").Execute();
```

The `Where` function can take other operators too: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `contains_any`, `array-contains-any`, `in`, `not-in`.

Queries looking for `null` values can also be given:
```javascript
const allDocumentsNullNames = firestore.query("FirstCollection").Where("name", null).Execute();
```

Query results can be ordered:
```javascript
const allDocumentsNameAsc = firestore.query("FirstCollection").OrderBy("name").Execute();
const allDocumentsNameDesc = firestore.query("FirstCollection").OrderBy("name", "desc").Execute();
```

To limit, offset, or just select a range of results:
```javascript
const documents2_3_4_5 = firestore.query("FirstCollection").Limit(4).Offset(2).Execute();
const documents3_4_5_6 = firestore.query("FirstCollection").Range(3, 7).Execute();
```

See other library methods and details [in the wiki](../../../wiki).

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **I'm getting the following error:**
  > Missing ; before statement. at \[unknown function\](Auth:12)

  This is because this library has been updated to utilize the new [V8 Engine](//developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime), and classes are not supported in the Rhino Engine.
  You can either:
    1. [Migrate your script to use V8](//developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime/migration), or
    1. Use the last Rhino version of this library (**v26**).


### Breaking Changes
- **v27:** Library rewritten with Typescript and Prettier.
  - Query function names have been capitalized (`Select`, `Where`, `OrderBy`, `Limit`, `Offset`, `Range`).
  -  **All functions return `Document` or `Document[]` types directly from Firebase. Use `document.obj` to extract the raw object.**
  -  Undo breaking change from v23. `document.createTime` and `document.updateTime` will remain as timestamped strings. However `document.created`, `document.updated`, and `document.read` are Date objects.
- **v23:** When retrieving documents the createTime and updateTime document properties are JS Date objects and not Timestamp Strings.
- **v16:** **Removed:** `createDocumentWithId(documentId, path, fields)`
  > Utilize `createDocument(path + '/' + documentId, fields)` instead to create a document with a specific ID.
